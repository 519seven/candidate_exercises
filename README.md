# Welcome to Candidate Exercises #

# Introduction #

What you see here is a collection of a few simple  exercises designed to test several programming concepts using strings, numbers, lists/arrays, objects/classes, modules/packages, data/text processing, etc.  Each exercise can be solved using a variety of techniques ranging from beginner to novice to expert.  Do not be surprised if you have seen some of these before.  They are not designed to be tricky or have many dependencies.

These exercises are meant to give us a tangible, albeit quite general, idea of how you solve a few problems.  If everything goes well, they will provide some insight into many traits and skills that cannot be defined by a resume alone.
    
> * Rarely, will we require you to focus on a specific language to solve the exercise
> * If you are applying for a specific role as a Python developer, for example, we will request you to complete the work using Python 3.10
> * If you don't feel like it has been made on which language to use, use the language you're most comfortable with, favoring heavily toward Python or Golang, preferably.  If you prefer clarification, please reach out to your technical point of contact

 # The Setup #
 
If you are unsure how to proceed with setup, please reach out to your technical point of contact.

> * Use common `git` tools to download or clone this repository to your file system
> * Access the files using your favorite IDE or command line
> * Use virtual environment controls to contain and customize your setup when appropriate
> * **For Python**
>     * Target Python version is `3.10.8`
>     * This environment was managed by `pipenv`


## The Target Environment ##

This collection of stand-alone scripts can be run from within a typical software development environment with an interpretor as required.

## The Comment Section ##

Within the first 40 or so lines of each exercise file is a `comment section` containing a **description** of the exercise and a few **test cases**, if applicable.  If they are present, rely on these test cases to provide clarity to anything that may have not been clear in the description.

> If you are not sure what you are being asked to do in a certain exercise, please let your point of contact know at some point; but, to reduce delays, **it is recommended you pick an exercise that makes sense** so you can make the most of your time.

 # What We Are Asking You To Do #
We are more interested in things done well rather than things done quickly - quality not quantity. 

> 1. Select 2 - 4 exercises to complete before your follow-up interview.  
> 1. Your script ought to produce the same pass/fail for each script's test case, when and where appropriate.
> 1. If you are not able to complete your chosen scripts that is okay.  We are using this exercise to start a conversation and understand how you process the task at hand and how you work through the parts that may be tricky.

## Where To Get Help ##

You can get help from resources you typically use - online or from reference materials.  We do, however, ask that you DO NOT get help from a mentor or colleague.  **This work is to be done by you and only by you.**


# Share Your Work #
 
 We will ask you to share your desktop during your follow-up interview.  You can run your code from your environment.  **One hour before the interview, we would like to review your code.**
 
 > There are several ways to share your work with us.  We will leave it up to you but a few suggestions are:
> * push the code back to this repository through a pull request
> * fork this repository and store the code in your github account
> * send your work to us through email
> * etc.


# Review And Discuss #

During the follow-up interview, we expect you to guide us through the exercises you chose to tackle.  We will rely on you to review sections that were noteworthy and to walk us through your challenges and thought process.  Comments in the code are highly encouraged.  We may ask questions to pull more information from you or to have you explain your process in more detail.

There are no right answers.  Do your best to demonstrate how you understand your skill level to be by writing code you understand and can discuss with us.  We realize the scale is wide-ranging for skill levels within a certain language and across languages.  This process helps us know what it is like to share a common piece of code between us and to discuss its architecture and challenges and possibly solutions.

**Good luck and if you need any assistance, do not hesitate to reach out.  Take a deep breath and relax - you got this!**
