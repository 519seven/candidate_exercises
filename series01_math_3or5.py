# # Description
# # # Taken from ProjectEuler.net
#     If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
#     we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#
#     Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# *****************************************************************************
# Easy - loops

# initalize variables
my_threesandfives = []
answer = 0

# perform your exercise here using a loop(s)
for i in range(1000):
    pass

# store sum of your list in answer
answer = 0

# print your solution
print(f"The answer using a loop is: {answer}")

# *****************************************************************************
# Medium - list comprehension(s) and built-ins

# initialize variables
my_threesandfives = []
answer = 0

# supply your list comprehension solution here
my_threesandfives = []

# store sum of your list in "answer"
answer = 0  

# print your answer
print(f"The answer using a list comprehensive and built-in is: {answer}")

# *****************************************************************************
# Expert - using NumPy

# initialize variables
my_threesandfives = []
answer = 0

# supply your numpy solution here

# store sum of your list in "answer"
answer = 0

# print your answer
print(f"The answer using NumPy and built-ins is: {my_threesandfives.sum()}")
